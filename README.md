# Driver Drowsiness Detection

Exhausted drivers who doze off at the wheel are responsible for about 40% of road accidents, says a study by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) on the 300-km Agra-Lucknow Expressway.

Even though this is the era of autonomous cars, but human attentiveness is still required, because the AIs ar not that advanced yet.

To prevent those accidents from happening we can use this software as a prevention measure.

The data you will get from this source will have all the four folders (Closed, Open, no_yawn, and yawn) will be in the same directory. For using this program, you have to bring out those folders out side and make a structure like this:
